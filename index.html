Like Bonifacio, they have an assurance that everything may be fine if they embrace the ideals, motivation, grit, and endurance Bonifacio had shown. If Bonifacio is the face of the struggle for freedom, Bonifacio is also the face of the everyday struggling Filipino in surviving their own specific ordeals.</p>
